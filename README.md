Addon created with Copilot

It just smart addon I needed to update people officers notes in guild by just clicking button for each edit.

You start addon with /AGN and then paste into box text in form:
Name-Realm;note

Each character in separate line. Each button click will add note to that character and then remove that line so button can be spammed.

If you want to take it and build it better (like adding loop so one click does entire list) or other stuff. Feel free.
I will not upload it to any addon website, because let be serious it's more of excel macro than WoW addon, so if you want to upload your fixed version feel free, just let me know so I can install it.
